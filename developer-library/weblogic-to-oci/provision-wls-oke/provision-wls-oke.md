# Provision Oracle WebLogic Server on Oracle Kubernetes Engine

## Introduction

We will walk you through provisioning the WebLogic Infrastructure on Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) by leveraging the OCI Cloud Marketplace.

Estimated Completion Time: 30 minutes.

### Objectives

- Provision Oracle WebLogic Server on OKE via the Oracle Cloud Marketplace offering.
- Gather information for further steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have prepared the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tenancy with:

- A Vault.
- A Key.
- A Secret for the WebLogic Admin password.
- A Secret for the OCI Registry Auth Token.


## **STEP 1:** Provision the Stack Through the Marketplace

1. Go to **Solutions and Platforms**.

   ![](./images/provision-1.png " ")

2. In the search input, type `weblogic` and click **WebLogic Enterprise Edition on OKE UCM**.

   ![](./images/provision-2.png " ")

3. Make sure you are in the compartment that you want to use, use the default WebLogic version available, accept the license agreement and click **Launch the Stack**.

   ![](./images/provision-3.png " ")

4. Name the stack and click **Next**.

   ![](./images/provision-4.png " ")

5. Enter a **Resource Name Prefix**.

   It will be used to prefix the name of all the resources (domain, managed servers, admin server, cluster, machines and so on.).

   The next steps in this workshop assumes the resource name prefix is `nonjrf`, so it is highly recommended to use this name.

6. Provide an **SSH key**.

   To connect to the WebLogic servers via SSH, you need to provide a public key the server will use to identify your computer.

   Since the various commands will be ran from inside the on-premises environment (either the workshop compute instance or the local docker containers), you will need to provide the key generated in the on-premises environment.

   ![](./images/provision-8-sshkey.png " ")

7. To output the public key information, use the following command from inside the on-premises environment as the `oracle` user.

   ```
    <copy>
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    </copy>
    ```
    Copy the output of the command (the whole multi-line output) and paste it in the form field for SSH key in the form.

    The output will look something like this:

    ```bash
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDlkF23qLyfimJ9Vp4D9psp7bDOB8JvtY/pfYzFxIA2E4v6or+XhvMW5RDhX9Ba54zQNNDLvwUhStdXKkiMXJtEQJarFn45pGy/lyUQKFJolAdHBrXJsg5XWn4DxCFeQUQe1szVfmwDLAktAS14r5g76h3CcA8Kk/cNVqevxVChyejuuOdtAMoriIC8uKV+535qPs/GMiu0zR9aW4w1VodL5eHnXjqdgp8Fr21dVUVQ6of+s/ws0zlQUwghrNguDUqlggzG2mpLBHExypxCrJYmsb05uYjjqVlC3YCatj4nJTIHKLCFiYVY/b8AFkqwXV9EYlja5bjTmunM847dcR8H oracle@ad753161734c
    ```

    > **Note:** Do not use the example above as the key: it is a different public key which is useless without the corresponding private key, and you will not be able to access your resources on OCI)

8. Keep the default of *2* for **Managed Server Count**.

9. Use the standard *weblogic* for **Administration User Name**.

   ![](./images/provision-11-admin-name.png " ")

10. Paste the **OCID** of the **Secret** generated previously for the **Secret OCID for Administration Password**.

    ![](./images/provision-12-secret.png " ")

11. Click the **WebLogic Advanced Configuration** and enter the name **nonjrf_domain** for the domain name.

    ![](./images/domain-name.png " ")

12. Under **WebLogic Cluster (OKE) Configuration**, the Kubernetes version is default and select a **Shape** you have available in your tenancy.

    In a real world situation, choose a shape appropriate to handle the load of a single managed server. Since we're using a trial account, choose the **VM.Standard.E2.1** shape, the **VM.Standard.E2.2** shape or a suitable shape that is available in your tenancy.

    ![](./images/shape.png " ")

    To check shape availability, in another tab, on the **Governance** menu, click **Limits and Quotas**, and verify you have a specific shape available.

13. Select the **Number of Nodes in the WebLogic Pool** to 1 for now.

    ![](./images/node-in-wls-pool.png " ")

14. Select a shape and number of nodes for the non-WebLogic pool (for infra services like Jenkins).

    ![](./images/node-in-non-wls-pool.png " ")

15. Keep the **CIDR** block the default.

    ![](./images/cidr.png " ")

16. Under **Container Cluster (OKE) Administration Instances**, select an **Availability Domain** and shapes for the **Administration Server Compute Shape** and **Bastion Instance Shape**.

    ![](./images/admin-bastion-shape.png " ")

17. Under **Network**, select **Create New VCN** and keep the other defaults.

    ![](./images/create-vcn.png " ")

18. For **Database**, select **No Database**. This is only needed for a JRF domain. We will provision the application database separately.

    ![](./images/no-database.png " ")

19. Select an **Availability Domain** for the **File System**.

    ![](./images/file-system-ad.png " ")

20. Under Registry (OCIR) enter your full **Username**, which you find under your **User icon**.

    ![](./images/username.png " ")

21. Enter the **OCID** of the secret for the **OCI Registry Auth Token**.

    ![](./images/ocir-secret.png " ")

22. Click **Create**.

    ![](./images/provision-25.png " ")

23. The stack will get provisioned using the **Resource Manager**. This may take 7 to 15 minutes.

    ![](./images/provision-26.png " ")

Once the stack is provisioned, you can find the information regarding the URL and IP of the WebLogic Admin server in the logs, or in the **Outputs** left-side menu.

## **STEP 2:** Gather Deployment Information

Go to **Outputs** (or you can find the same information at the bottom of the logs).

You should see something like the following:

![](./images/provision-28.png " ")

- Make a note of the **WebLogic Admin Server Private IP address** from the **WebLogic Admin Server Console URL** for later use.

- Make a note of the **Load Balancer IP** for later use.

- Make a note of the Bastion Instance **Public IP address** for later use.

To access the WebLogic Admin console, you will need to create a tunnel through the bastion host to your local machine.

We'll need to set up a tunnel through the Bastion Instance, with a dynamic port to connect to the Admin Console and the Jenkins UI with the browser.

## **STEP 3:** Set Up Connectivity

1. Extract the SSH key from the on-premises environment:

   In the *Docker* environment, the key pair (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`) is exported for you in the `weblogic-to-oci/ssh/` folder.

   If your used the marketplace demo image, you need to extract the key to your local machine.

   Since we only have SSH access with the `opc` user, the key first needs to be moved to the opc user home and then exported.

   In the on-premises VM, as the oracle user:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    sudo cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa /home/opc/
    </copy>
    ```

   Exit the oracle user shell, and exit the VM, by typing `exit` twice.

   On your local machine shell:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    mkdir ssh
    scp opc@<DEMO_ENV_IP>:~/id_rsa ./ssh/
    </copy>
    ```

   The key `id_rsa` will now be in your local folder.

2. Create a dynamic port tunnel through the Bastion Instance.

   Use the following command to create a tunnel from the WLS admin server to your local machine.

    ```bash
    <copy>
    ssh -i ./ssh/id_rsa -C -D 1088 opc@$<BASTION_IP>
    </copy>
    ```

   Using Putty:
    1. Create a new Session to `opc@<BASTION_IP>` with port 22.
    2. In **Host Keys**, locate the `id_rsa` private key obtained earlier.
    3. On the **Connections** menu, click **SSH**, **Tunnels**, then click **Dynamic**.
    4. Enter **Source Port: 1088** then **Add**.
    5. Click **Open** to open the tunnel connection.

3. Set up Socksv5 Proxy in Firefox.

   In Firefox browser, go to **Preferences**.

   1. Search for **Proxy**.

      ![](./images/firefox-proxy1.png " ")

   2. Click **Settings**.

   3. Click **Manual Proxy** setup.

   4. Enter **localhost** and port **1088**.

      ![](./images/firefox-proxy2.png " ")

## **Step 4:** Check the Deployment

1. Find the private load balancer IP under the following menu settings: **Core Infrastructure**, **Networking**, **Load Balancers**.

2. Find the load balancer marked *Private* and note the IP address.

   ![](./images/lb-oke.png " ")

3. In Firefox, go to `http://PRIVATE_LOAD_BALANCER_IP/console` to find the WebLogic Admin console.

   ![](./images/wls-empty.png " ")

   You should find the deployment list is empty under **Deployments**.

4. Go to `http://PRIVATE_LOAD_BALANCER_IP/jenkins` to get to the Jenkins Console.

   You will be prompted to create a default admin user, and then you can see the Jenkins UI and pipelines.
