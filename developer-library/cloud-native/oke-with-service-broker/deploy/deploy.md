# Deploy an OKE Cluster with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Service Broker

## Introduction

You will deploy the Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) cluster with the OCI Service Broker, using the quickstart repository at [https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oke-with-service-broker](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oke-with-service-broker).

Estimated Time: 30 minutes.

### Objectives

- Clone the repository.
- Populate parameter files.
- Run the Terraform script to deploy the OKE cluster with OSB.
- Verify the deployment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have installed the required software:

- kubectl
- Helm
- OCI CLI

## **STEP 1:** Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository with the following command:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oke-with-service-broker
    cd oke-with-service-broker
    </copy>
    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the code from GitHub at [https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oke-with-service-broker](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oke-with-service-broker).

## **STEP 2:** Create a `terraform.tfvars` File

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file from the `terraform.tfvars.template` file (make a copy and rename it `terraform.tfvars).

    ```bash
    <copy>
    cp terraform.tfvars.template terraform.tfvars
    </copy>
    ```

2. Edit the required variables with the values for your environment.

    The following variables are required:

    ```hcl
    tenancy_ocid = ""
    compartment_ocid = ""
    region = "us-ashburn-1"
    ssh_authorized_key = ""
    secrets_encryption_key_ocid = null
    ```

    - `region` and `tenancy_ocid` should match the values in your environment.

    - `compartment_ocid` is the OCID of the compartment where the stack will be deployed. If you have not created a compartment, create one and get the OCID by going to the Oracle Cloud Console and selecting  **Identity** and then **Compartments**. Select the compartment to use to see its details and retrieve the OCID.

    - `ssh_authorized_key` is the content of your public key used for ssh. This will give you access to the worker nodes of the Kubernetes cluster if need be.

        You can use the `oci_api_key_public` you created when installing the OCI CLI or your default ssh key usually located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` on Mac or Linux machines.

        To output the content of the key use:

        ```bash
        <copy>
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        </copy>
        ```

        Copy the full output and then paste it into the `terraform.tfvars` file within the quotes.

    - If you want to encrypt Kubernetes secrets at rest, then provide an encryption key OCID for `secrets_encryption_key_ocid`.

        You need to have created a **Vault** and an **Encryption Key** to use this feature, you also need to have permission to create a dynamic group; otherwise, keep the value `null`.

    - If you do not have permission to create users or groups, provide your user_ocid to be used for all users, and ideally, provide an auth token when required.

    ```bash
    # If you do not have permission to create users, provide the user_ocid of a user
    # that has permission to pull images from OCI Registry
    ocir_puller_user_ocid        = null

    # If the user provided above already has an auth_token to use, provide it here.
    # If null a new token will be created.
    # This requires that the user has 1 token at most already (as there is a limit of 2 tokens per user)
    ocir_puller_auth_token = null

    # If you have permission to create users, and a group already exists with policies
    # to pull images from OCI Registry, you can provide the group_ocid
    # and a new user will be created and be made a member of this group
    # Leave null if you are providing a ocir_puller_user_ocid
    ocir_puller_group_ocid = null

    # If you do not have permission to create users, provide the user_ocid of a user
    # that has permission to create Autonomous Database, Object Storage buckets and Streams
    ocir_puller_user_ocid        = null

    # If you have permission to create users, and a group already exists with policies to pull images from OCI Registry, you can provide the group_ocid
    # and a new user will be created and be made a member of this group
    # Leave null if you are providing a osb_user_ocid
    osb_group_ocid = null
    ```

## **STEP 3:** Initialize the Terraform Repository

1. Initialize the Terraform project with:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    terraform init
    </copy>
    ```

## **STEP 4:** Deploy the Stack

1. If you wish to see the plan for the deployment, use:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    terraform plan
    </copy>
    ```

2. Deploy the stack with:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    terraform apply
    </copy>
    ```

    Type **yes** at the prompt to confirm.

    This will take between 20 and 40 minutes.

## **STEP 5:** Verify the Deployment

If the deployment went smoothly, you should not see errors in the Terraform log, and it should be done within 45 minutes.

1. Check the presence of the pods in the `oci-service-broker` namespace.

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl get pods -n oci-service-broker
    </copy>
    ```

    You should see an output like:

    ```bash
    NAME                                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    catalog-catalog-controller-manager-dc65bcd87-zs5vj       1/1     Running   0          2m
    catalog-catalog-webhook-d6694bdf8-tmtbv                  1/1     Running   0          2m
    etcd-0                                                   1/1     Running   0          2m
    etcd-1                                                   1/1     Running   0          2m
    etcd-2                                                   1/1     Running   0          2m
    oci-service-broker-oci-service-broker-67ddfbf76b-rbsvt   1/1     Running   0          2m
    ```

2. Check the presence of the OCI Service Broker classes and plans:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl get all
    </copy>
    ```

    You should see an output containing:

    ```bash

    ```

## **Step 6:** Access the Kubernetes Dashboard

1. To access the Kubernetes dashboard, run the helper script:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    ./access_k8s_dashboard.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    The script will display a token, set up kubeproxy and open the browser to the Kubernetes dashboard page.

2. Copy the token from the script output and paste it at the login prompt, and you can then navigate to the various resources.

You may proceed to the next lab.
