### What Is Oracle Visual Builder?
Oracle Visual Builder provides easy access to data from any REST-based service, and lets you create reusable business objects for storing and managing data. Using the cloud-based visual development tools, you can create and test responsive web applications and native mobile apps without having to install any additional software. The visual designer enables you to quickly lay out pages in your applications by dragging and dropping UI components, customizing their attributes, and defining their behavior.
