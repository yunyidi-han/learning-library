# Building Microservices with Oracle Converged Database
## Introduction and Overview

This workshop will help you understand the technical capabilities inside and outside the Oracle converged database to support a scalable data and event-driven microservices architecture.

<if type="multicloud-freetier">
The workshop will also help you understand multi-cloud deployments of microservices architectures, observability via Grafana, Kibana, and other tools, and Verrazzano.

You will create an application with Helidon microservices and a Javascript front-end, deployed to an OCI Kubernetes cluster, using REST and messaging for communication and accessing pluggable Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing databases.
