# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop shows a scenario on how to achieve Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) in Oracle APEX.

This shows the flow to develop an APEX application and promote it from a development environment to production (or test or staging environment), using version control to keep track of application code changes as well as schema migrations.

The process takes advantage of Terraform to deploy the infrastructure, Liquibase which is integrated in the Oracle SQLcl command line tool, as well as git and APEX specific app management functionalities.

Estimated Completion Time: 45 minutes.

### Objectives

Learn how to setup an environment and process to develop and deploy APEX application across several environments.

In this workshop, you will:
- Get a repository template with scripts to implement a CI/CD type workflow.
- Install Oracle SQLcl required to run the commands.
- Deploy a development Oracle Autonomous Database with three pre-production environments (dev, tst, stg) and a production Oracle Autonomous Database with the production environment (prd), using Terraform.
- Install a sample application we'll use as a starting point on the dev environment.
- Snapshot the application and schema, deploy the application to production. Make changes to it and redeploy.
- Learn to rollback changes.
