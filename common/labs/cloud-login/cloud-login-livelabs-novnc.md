# Getting Started - LiveLabs Login

## Introduction

To get started, you need to have an active Oracle Cloud account and a LiveLabs reservation. An Oracle Cloud account is free and needed to gain access to your LiveLabs reservation, Oracle Support, and other Oracle publicly-accessible content.

If you already have an Oracle Cloud account, you can skip to Step 2.

If you already have a reservation, skip to the next lab to start your workshop!

## STEP 1: **Create an Oracle Account**

Creating an Oracle account can be summarized in the following two simple steps.

1. Navigate to [oracle.com](http://www.oracle.com), Click on *View Account*, and Select *Create an Account*
