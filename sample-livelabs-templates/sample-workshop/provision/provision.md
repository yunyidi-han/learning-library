## **STEP 0**: Use these Standardized Pictures for Oracle Cloud Navigation (Commonly for Provisioning)

***Please use the absolute path pictures in this section when describing Oracle Cloud navigation in your workshops. This will enable us to quickly update all workshops in the future if there happens to be an Oracle Cloud user interface change.  It also increases consistency across LiveLabs workshops and contributes to a more professional feel.  Browse below and view the markdown in an editor to find the related images. We highly recommend you copy this whole section in the markdown file and paste it to a text document for easy copy and pasting of links.***

## **STEP 1**: title

Step 1 opening paragraph.

1. Sub step 1

  To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use this format:

  Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

  *Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)*

2. Sub step 2 with image and link to the text description below. The `sample1.txt` file must be added to the `files` folder.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png "Image title")

3. Ordered list item 3 with the same image but no link to the text description below.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png)

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. One example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

6. This is an example of manual control over image sizes:

  No image sizing applied: `![](images/pic2.png)`

  ![](images/pic2.png)

  50% of the width and use auto height: `![](images/pic2.png =50%x*)`

  ![](images/pic2.png =50%x*)

  absolute width and height (500 pixel by 200 pixels): `![](./images/pic2.png =500x200)`

  ![](./images/pic2.png =500x200)

  50% for both width and height:  `![](./images/pic2.png =50%x50%)`

  ![](./images/pic2.png =50%x50%)

## **STEP 2:** title

1. Sub step 1

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy></copy>.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

	```
  <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
  ```

*At the conclusion of the lab add this statement:*
You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
