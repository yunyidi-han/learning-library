# Working with JSON collections using the SODA (Simple Oracle Document Access) API

## Introduction

Oracle is a relational database, meaning it typically stores data in rows and column of tables and JSON can be stored as a column value. For this lab though we first focus on the Document Store API SODA (Simple Oracle Document Access) which allows to store JSON data in a so-called collection. A JSON collection stores JSON documents alongside some metadata like the time of creation or update. Collections offer operations like inserts, deletes, index creation or queries.

In order to create a collection all you have to specify is the collection's name. Unlike a relational table you do not have to provide any schema information. So, lets create a collection for the products we want to sell in the store.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create Collection
* Insert First Document
* Finding JSON document in a collection
* JSON and Constraints

### Prerequisites

* Have provisioned an Autonomous JSON Database instance and logged into the JSON

## **STEP 1**: Create Collection

1. To create a collection, click **Create Collection**.

3. A New JSON Document panel displays. Copy the following JSON object, paste it in the worksheet and click **Create**.

	```
	<copy>
	{
		"id": 100,
		"type":"movie",
		"title": "Coming to America",
		"format": "DVD",
		"condition": "acceptable",
		"price": 5,
		"comment": "DVD in excellent condition, cover is blurred",
		"starring": ["Eddie Murphy", "Arsenio Hall", "James Earl Jones", "John Amos"],
		"year": 1988,
		"decade": "80s"
	}
	</copy>
	```

4. A notification pops up that says A New Document is created and the new document is shown in the bottom section of the JSON workshop.

	![](./images/popup2.png)

5. Let's repeat this with the following documents:

	Click New JSON Document button, copy the following JSON objects one by one, paste it in the worksheet and click **Create**.

    ```
	<copy>
	{
		"id": 101,
		"title": "The Thing",
		"type": "movie",
		"format": "DVD",
		"condition": "like new",
		"price": 9.50,
		"comment": "still sealed",
		"starring": [
			"Kurt Russel",
			"Wilford Brimley",
			"Keith David"
		],
		"year": 1982,
		"decade": "80s"
	}
	</copy>
	```

	```
	<copy>
	{
		"id": 102,
		"title": "Aliens",
		"type": "movie",
		" format ": "VHS",
		"condition": "unknown, cassette looks ok",
		"price": 2.50,
		"starring": [
			"Sigourney Weaver",
			"Michael Bien",
			"Carrie Henn"
		],
		"year": 1986,
		"decade": "80s"
	}
	</copy>
	```

	```
	<copy>
		{
		"id": 103,
		"title": "The Thing",
		"type": "book",
		"condition": "okay",
		"price": 2.50,
		"author":"Alan Dean Forster",
		"year": 1982,
		"decade": "80s"
	}
	</copy>
	```

## **STEP 3:** Finding JSON documents in a collection

Documents can be selected based on filter conditions - we call them 'Queries By Example' or 'QBE' for short. A QBE is a JSON document itself and it contains the fields and filter conditions that a JSON document in the collection must satisfy in order to be selected. QBEs are used with SODA (only); you can use SQL functions as an alternative.

The simplest form of a QBE just contains a key-value pair. Any selected document in the collection must have the same key with the same value. More complex QBEs can contain multiple filter conditions or operators like 'negation' or 'and', etc.

The following are examples for QBEs. You can copy them into the corresponding window (see screenshot) and execute them. Obviously, in a real application those QBE-expressions would be issued directly from the programming language - the SODA drivers have APIs for common application programming languages: Python, etc.

Now let's issue some simple queries on the *products* collection we just created.

1. Copy and paste the following queries in the worksheet and click Run Query button to run a query.

2.  Lookup by one value:

	Here, it displays the document whose id value is 101.

	```
	<copy>
	{"id":101}
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/id101.png)
	![](./images/id101-results.png)

3.	Find all DVDs:

	Running the query will displays two documents with format DVD.

	```
	<copy>
	{"format":"DVD"}
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/dvd-results.png)

4.	Find all non-movies:

	This query displays the documents that are not of type - movies i.e., which means just the document with id 103.

	```
	<copy>
	{"type":{"$ne":"movie"}}
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/not-movies.png)

5.	Find documents whose condition value contains "new", which means just document (with id) 101.

	```
	<copy>
	{"condition":{"$like":"%new%"}}
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/new.png)

6. Find bargains of all products costing 5 or less:

	This query displays the documents with ids 100, 102 and 103 as those documents have price less than 5.

	```
	<copy>
	{"price":{"$lte":5}}
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/less5.png)

7. Tighten previous query to choose only movie documents:

	This query displays the documents whose ids are 100, 102 as those documents have price less than 5 and not the type - book.

	```
	<copy>
	{"$and":[{"price":{"$lte":5}}, {"type":"movie"}]}
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/less5-movie.png)

## **STEP 4:** JSON and Constraints

Some values need to be unique, so how do we enforce this?

1.	Insert a duplicate document for the id - 100:

	Click New JSON Document icon, copy and paste the following query in the worksheet and click **Create**.

	The document is successfully inserted as duplicate id's are not prevented and JSON database is schemaless.

	```
	<copy>
	{
		"id": 100,
		"fruit": "banana"
	}
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/step4.1.png)

2. Use QBE:

	Copy and paste the following query in the worksheet and click **Run Query**.

	The result now shows two documents with id 100. Let's delete the last inserted document by clicking on the trash bin button.

	```
	<copy>
	{"id":100}
	</copy>
	```

	![](./images/id100-2.png)

	It is likely we are looking up products by their id. Let's a create an index that gives fast access to 'id'. Make sure id is unique and numeric.

	Now we use a field 'id' in the JSON document to identify the product. The value could also be a SKU (barcode) or some catalog number. Obviously, every product needs an id and we want this to be a unique numeric value across all documents in the collection. Also, we want to be able to quickly find a product using the id value. So, let's create a unique index that solves all requirements (unique, numeric, present).

3.	Let's navigate to SQL Developer Web. Click the navigation menu on the top left and select **SQL** under Development.

	![](./images/sql-dw.png)

4. Copy and paste the query below in the worksheet and click Run query button to creates a unique index that solves all requirements (unique, numeric, present).

	```
	<copy>
	create unique index product_id_idx on products (JSON_VALUE(json_document, '$.id.number()' ERROR ON ERROR));
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/index.png)

	JSON_Value is a SQL/JSON function that extracts one value from the JSON data that is specified by a JSON Path Expression - in this case we extract the 'id' and convert the selected value to a SQL number. Here, *$.id.number()* is a standard, SQL/JSON path expression. You'll learn more about SQJ/JSON functions later in this lab.

	*Learn more -* [SQL/JSON Path Expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/adjsn/json-path-expressions.html#GUID-2DC05D71-3D62-4A14-855F-76E054032494)

5.	Once the product\_id\_idx is created, navigate back to JSON workshop. Click the navigation menu on the top left and select **JSON** under Development.

	![](./images/json-nav.png)

6.	Try to insert some documents that do not have an id or a non-numeric id:

	Click New JSON Document icon, copy and paste the following query in the worksheet and click **Create**.

	Although the "id" is unique the insert fails throws the error "Unable to add new JSON document" because the value is not a number. The same happens if the id is missing or already in use. Try it!

	```
	<copy>
	{"id":"xxx","title":"Top Gun"}
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/create-error.png)
	![](./images/error.png)

7.  While we're at it lets add more 'checks' - we call them 'constraints'. Navigate back to the SQL Developer Web. Click the navigation menu on the top left and select **SQL** under Development.

	![](./images/nav.png)

8. Check constraint to make sure every product has a title of string data type and price >=0. Add a constraint to make sure that every item has at least a title and the price. We want the price to be a non-negative number and title to be a string.

	Copy and paste the query below in the worksheet and click Run query button to run the SQL query to alter products table and add constraints.

	```
	<copy>
	alter table products add constraint required_fields check (JSON_EXISTS(json_document, '$?(@.title.type() == "string" && @.price.number() > 0)'));
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/sql-query.png)

	JSON_Exists is a SQL/JSON function that checks that a SQL/JSON path expression selects at least one value in the JSON data. The selected value(s) are not extracted â€“ only their existence is checked. Here, *$?(@.title.type() == "string" && @.price.number() > 0)* i a standard, SQL/JSON path expressions. You'll learn more about SQJ/JSON functions later in this lab.

9. Once the *products* table is altered, navigate back to JSON workshop. Click the navigation menu on the top left and select **JSON** under Development.

	![](./images/nav2-json.png)

10. Validate that the following documents cannot get inserted as fields are missing or of wrong type.

	Click New JSON Document icon, copy and paste the following query in the worksheet and click **Create**.

	Throws the error "Unable to add new JSON document" since the following document has missing fields while trying to insert.

	```
	<copy>
	{"id":"200","title":"Top Gun"}
	</copy>
	```
	![](./images/tester.png)
	![](./images/error2.png)

11. The following document now satisfies all the constraints: the "id" is a unique number, the title is a string, and the price is a positive number.

	```
	<copy>
	{
		"id": 200,
		"title": "Top Gun",
		"category": "VHS",
		"condition": "like new",
		"price": 8,
		"starring": [
			"Tom Cruise",
			"Kelly McGillis",
			"Anthony Edwards",
			"Val Kilmer"
		],
		"year": 1986,
		"decade": "80s"
	}
	</copy>
	```
