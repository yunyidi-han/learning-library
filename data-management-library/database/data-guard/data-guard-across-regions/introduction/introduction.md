# Introduction

This workshop shows you how to set up Oracle Data Guard across two cloud regions.  Oracle Data Guard provides disaster recovery for your Oracle databases.  A standby database is set up to receive redo transaction logs from the primary database.  In the event of a disaster on the primary database, a failover to the standby database will occur.  

For disaster recovery, it is a common practice to set up the primary and standby database in two different data centers preferably located in different geographies.  In this guide we will be setting up Oracle Data Guard between two cloud regions using Oracle Database Cloud Service.  

### Prerequisites

- An Oracle Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account with access to more than one cloud region

- Oracle Cloud user role to manage networks and databases

- SSH public and private keys

- Compartment to work on

This workshop assumes you understand Oracle Cloud, VCNs, CIDR blocks and subnets.

Estimated workshop time:  45 minutes
