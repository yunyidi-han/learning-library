# Loading Data

## Introduction

This lab will load sample data in Autonomous Database for use with Lab 5 (Using Data Transforms).

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Load Data from Oracle Object Store to Autonomous Database

### Prerequisites

- All previous labs have been successfully completed.
- Basic familiarity of Autonomous Database

## **STEP 1:** Load Data from Oracle Object Store to Autonomous Database

We need to load the `Movie_Sales_2020.csv` file which is stored in an Object Storage public bucket. We will set up connection to Oracle Object Store and load the file.

1. In Autonomous Database, navigate to **Data Load**.

2. On the Data Load main page, click the **Cloud Locations** card to define a new connection to your object store.

3. Click the **Add Cloud Storage** button on the upper right and define a Cloud Storage location as follows:

    | **Field** | **Value** | **Notes** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Name | MOVIE_SALES | Lower case names not currently supported  |
    | Description |Movie Sales |  |
    | URI + Bucket | [https://objectstorage.uk-london-1.oraclecloud.com/n/adwc4pm/b/MovieStream/o/](https://objectstorage.uk-london-1.oraclecloud.com/n/adwc4pm/b/MovieStream/o/) |  |
    | Credential | No credential | Radio Button |

When you have completed these details, press **Create**.

4. Navigate back to the Data Load main page and press the two cards for **Load Data** from **Cloud Storage** and press **Next**.

## **STEP 2:** Inspect the Data 

1. Navigate to the Data Load main page and press the **Explore** card.

2. You'll now see the table MOVIE\_SALES\_2020 has been loaded into our Autonomous Data Warehouse. Click on this table and then click **Source Statistics** on the panel to the left of the screen. You can think of this as a UI on top of the statistics that drive the optimizer of Oracle Database. In this case this data presents a nice simple way to characterize the data we've just loaded.
