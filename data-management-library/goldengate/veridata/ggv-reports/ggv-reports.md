# View Reports

## Introduction
A comparison report is generated for each job, group, and compare pair that is finished being processed. It contains summary details about out-of-sync row counts, the number of records processed, performance statistics, errors, and so forth.

The comparison report tells you how extensive an out-of-sync problem is. It also provides performance statistics and, optionally, column details. The comparison report can be viewed by any user role.
